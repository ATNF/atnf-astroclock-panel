# atnf-astroclock-panel

This is a simple panel to display 3 clocks with different time zones plus Local Sidereal Time (LST).
As used at The Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope (http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/index.html).

The clocks Title and timezone can be edited from the Options tab. For correct LST the longitude of
the site must also be entered.
